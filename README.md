## TODO

-   ~Convert JS to TS~
-   ~Implement multiple lists~
-   ~Switch to React context for user auth~
-   ~Create search bar (need to integrate with API)~
-   ~Integrate an API to work with pagination~
-   ~Add history and rating system~
-   Create a lowest price locator (Probably not doable?)
-   Add side shell to display data
-   Deploy website
-   ~Use own dataset since the API doesn't allow many api calls~
