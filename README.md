## Inspiration

As incoming first-year university students, we realized that we needed to cook on our own while managing our budget. Whenever we tried cooking, leftover ingredients were often wasted. To address this concern, we created a web application that helps manage your ingredients and recommends recipes based on your pantry inventory.

## What it does

While existing apps on the market focus on collecting and organizing recipes, we implemented an efficient approach to saving food, money, and time by recommending recipes based on remaining ingredients. Upon logging into our web app, users can add ingredients, search through recipes and follow them to plan and make their next meal.

## How we built it

We used React to develop the website’s UI and handled backend tasks with Firebase. We access the user inputted ingredients list to search for recipes containing those ingredients. Each link will bring the user to the recipe page with instructions.

## Challenges we ran into

We immediately ran into a problem with saving user data to Firebase since each ingredient doesn’t have a standard unit to compare to the recipe.

## What's next for FoodAdd

Food Addict can be expanded to incorporate more recipes for the customers hopefully using an online API such as spoonacular. This program could also be partnered with grocery delivering companies to help deliver what ingredients you might be missing. This would allow cooks to see what ingredients could be reused and buy what they needed.
